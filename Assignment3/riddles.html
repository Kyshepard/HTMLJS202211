        <p>Hello! My name is Kodiak Shepard, I am 19 year old and I am studying at NIET. I grew up in Lyme, New Hampshire. Being from NH I am not used to cities since I lived in a low population area my only friends were trees and video games. I like video games so much that I am studying to create them. Hopefully one day I can tell a wonderful story using video games as a medium. Growing up I played the sports basketball, soccer, and baseball. I only stuck with basketball and soccer as I got older. When it comes to Esports I am not a big fan of them because i prefer to play video games at a slow and non-competitive pace. Also I don't game enough of one game in particular to join a team for it. Thank you for reading about me!</p>
